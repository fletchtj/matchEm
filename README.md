##Match'Em App
A fun little app I made for my brother-in-law to use for his niece's birthday party.

Add your events and participants, and let the matches begin.
The application will select a random event and pairing each time you click the button.

###Getting Started
1. [Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).
2. Clone the repo. `git clone https://github.com/fletchtj/matchEm.git`
3. Change into the app directory, and run the `meteor` command to start the app.
4. Open a web browser and head to `http://localhost:3000/`
